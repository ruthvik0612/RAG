MACHINE LEARNING BASICS – PRACTICE NOTES

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

The core idea of machine learning is that instead of writing rules manually, we provide data and allow algorithms to learn relationships automatically.

--------------------------------------------------
TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

--------------------------------------------------
SUPERVISED LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------

Supervised learning uses labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output.

Example:
Input: House size, number of rooms
Output: House price

Common supervised learning tasks:
- Classification: Predicting categories or labels
- Regression: Predicting continuous numerical values

Examples of classification:
- Spam vs Non-spam email
- Fraud vs Non-fraud transaction

Examples of regression:
- Predicting house prices
- Predicting sales revenue

Common supervised algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

--------------------------------------------------
UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to discover hidden patterns or structures.

Common unsupervised tasks:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection

Examples:
- Customer segmentation
- Grouping similar documents
- Detecting unusual transactions

Common unsupervised algorithms:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders

--------------------------------------------------
REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------

Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

Key components:
- Agent: The learner or decision-maker
- Environment: The system the agent interacts with
- Action: A move taken by the agent
- Reward: Feedback from the environment
- Policy: Strategy used by the agent

Examples:
- Game playing (Chess, Go)
- Robotics
- Recommendation systems

--------------------------------------------------
MODEL TRAINING PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------

The general machine learning workflow includes:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Selection
6. Model Training
7. Model Evaluation
8. Model Deployment

--------------------------------------------------
TRAIN-TEST SPLIT
--------------------------------------------------

Data is usually split into:
- Training set (used to train the model)
- Testing set (used to evaluate performance)

Common split ratios:
- 80% train / 20% test
- 70% train / 30% test

--------------------------------------------------
EVALUATION METRICS
--------------------------------------------------

For classification:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

For regression:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared

--------------------------------------------------
OVERFITTING AND UNDERFITTING
--------------------------------------------------

Overfitting occurs when a model performs very well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture patterns in the data.

Common solutions:
- Regularization
- Cross-validation
- More data
- Feature selection

--------------------------------------------------
FEATURE ENGINEERING
--------------------------------------------------

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful input features.

Examples:
- Scaling numerical values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Creating interaction features
- Handling missing values

--------------------------------------------------
BATCH VS ONLINE LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------

Batch Learning:
- Model is trained on the entire dataset at once

Online Learning:
- Model is updated incrementally as new data arrives

--------------------------------------------------
REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------

Machine learning is used in:
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Autonomous vehicles
